		So far, the most common way to adapt an existing first-person shooter to VR has been to turn it into a shooting gallery, where you hold still and shoot targets as they pop up. Doom VFR is not that, at all. Instead of taking that route or converting the original version (as Bethesda did with Skyrim VR), id built VFR from the ground up as a new game that bravely embraces Doom’s love of movement and momentum. It lets you get up in the faces of demonic invaders in some of the fastest-paced VR action I’ve experienced yet. - IGN

    	Walking through the ruins of Boston in Fallout 4 VR is a sobering experience that makes the post-nuclear world feel that much more real. Fallout 4 clearly wasn’t built for this, as the troublesome Pip Boy menu system demonstrates all too well, but you can get around and defend yourself well enough that if you love Fallout and have a high-end PC and an HTC Vive, it’s hard to say no to. - IGN

    	When VR headsets became a reality, I made a list of games I wanted to experience from that perspective. It was primarily games with fantastic worlds – games like BioShock, Half-Life 2, and, naturally The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Since then it’s become clear that adapting conventional first-person games to VR wouldn’t be easy, and Bethesda’s Skyrim VR is an example of how many of those challenges remain unsolved. It’s definitely great virtual tourism in a familiar land of dragons and magic, but this perspective doesn’t do the famously clumsy combat any favors. - IGN

    	Call of Duty’s return to World War II is surprisingly a fast-paced take on the classic setting. It provides for a good campaign, a great new mode in multiplayer among other good changes, and a creepier, dense version of Nazi Zombies. However, each core part of Call of Duty: WW2 is marred by inconsistencies and minor flaws that hold it back from being a landmark in the series. Still, it’s a solid Call of Duty game and I’ve enjoyed the many hours I’ve already poured into it. - IGN
